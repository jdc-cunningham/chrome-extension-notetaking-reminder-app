Well... I feel like I went in circles.

I am still not sure if I'm safe (lol)

But this method vs. the other branch is way easier/less stuff to deal with.

And I don't have to worry about logging/persisting a token/shortcode.

I'll do some more research... I'm just trying to proactively protect myself from complacency.

Imagine using this thing for years and you realize it was hijacked and the data is being piped into somewhere.

Of course who cares... like it's rare. Your entire OS is compromised lol.

I'll improve this over time.
