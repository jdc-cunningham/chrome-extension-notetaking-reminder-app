Add eye icon to the iframe so you can toggle its transparency.

Also a draggable handle to move it.

I'm in a funk lately, not being productive anywhere
I just wanted to write a comment about the usage of this thing
At this moment I have disabled it everywhere I've applied it until I make the transparent/moveable mods.

It messes up some websites like YouTube the video player is partially blocked.

The other thing is... even though it's in my face, I don't interact with it which is interesting

I think I need it to blink or something to get my attention or popup on some schedule vs. always being there where it blends in with the background

I just expect it to be there

I have some time I'm going to work on this

There are a few things I want to address:

- hide text input area after modifying
- toggle to make the thing transparent
- handle to drag it (draggable)
- toggle to collapse it/make it small
  this would reset the width of the website
- ability to exclude this app from getting injected somewhere or at least
  get injected in a minimal form
- make CE icon dark

For the icons they'll be inline with the search area but not sure of what order makes sense

The draggable icon probably would be left-most.

But what about collapse...

I kinda feel like crap right now/did not sleep very much

Ehh... I'm spent

I'm going to modify the CPA API to show recently modified notes and ability to expand them.

Then pull that API output into this chrome extension

Hopefully I can do it I'm pretty spent

Then I have to go back to working with Swift

10:20 PM

I gotta figure out what variant of an API the CPA one is, I built it a while back

Variant as in changes on prod that I did that's not in the repo

Crap thing isn't on a repo, using systemd to run

Finally using grep, systemd file in a weird place, have to remember how to restart deamon

Oof... I don't think the name column is indexed damn... that query took a long time.

No it is indexed... hmm

took me a bit but found a query that works

Well... I feel like I went in circles.

I am still not sure if I'm safe (lol)

But this method vs. the other branch is way easier/less stuff to deal with.

And I don't have to worry about logging/persisting a token/shortcode.

I'll do some more research... I'm just trying to proactively protect myself from complacency.

Imagine using this thing for years and you realize it was hijacked and the data is being piped into somewhere.

Of course who cares... like it's rare. Your entire OS is compromised lol.

I'll improve this over time.

I forgot that the NANTA chrome extension is buggy, I'll have to fix that/improve it and... actually add the reminder part that I wanted

I'm gonna have to rework this... I got the concept down, it's nasty, I screwed up all the styling and what not ugh
